differents of programming language compiled (the compiled of code had some time for developer) The language is compiled to bytecode and interpretad to a virtual machine (JVM)
plataform x language: the language of programming language is the convention language to plataform java but it's not your only language. The advanteg of this plataform (once write, execute everywhere) is not only system of operations or hardware because the programmin could run in any virtual machine to be emulated. java se (java plataform, standard edition) java ee(java plataform, enterpreise edition) java me (java plataform, micro edition) Steps to execute JAVA: written the code source (file with extension .java) step 2 to use the JDK to compiled the code source and run the file bytecode(file with the extension .class) step3: to execute the program, the jvm read the compiled file (.class) and the library standard stay inside the JRE. JDK x JRE: Java development kit, it's a kit to development java responsable to compile the code-source (.java) in bytecode (.class) JVM (java virtual machine) it's a virtua machine java responsable to execute the bytecode (.class) JRE java runtime environment to execute java to supply standard java to JDK compiled the code to JVM and execute the programming.

export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME

// go to the end of file, so don't change nothing in this file
